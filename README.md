# linkedIn Games Solver

LinkedIn has daily logic puzzles that I enjoy doing, they're really quick and simple, and feature streaks to encourage user retention.
My favorite is Queens and Tango.

I wanted to solve these games with code because I'm breaking down the rules I follow into a proper algorithm.

My tango script can print if no solution is possible, but given that every daily linkedin tango puzzle has one solution, this shouldnt be expected.
However, this feature is useful for a "Build Your Own" tango puzzle feature, if you'd like to write your own to share with friends.

TODO:
Implement a way to retrieve each puzzle
GUI to input a tango puzzle then solve if possible.
Website to share your own Tango puzzle, where the custom puzzle is stored through the URL params.
